This repo displays my task-oriented advanced sql queries with a decent sized database.
My objective is to consolidate my practice with assessment exames into one excerise for myself.</br>
<b> This is non-academic assignment.</b> These excerises were designed by me to utlize comprehensive techniques to design simple solutions to daily data requests.

This database is made up of "fake" data used for learning purposes only. The ERD Diagram and database were not designed by me.
